# Cryptography
These are some of my codes in C++ and Python for Cryptography, while studying in BSc.CSIT fifth semester.  While I mostly do my projects myself, I do take references from a lot of sources for some complex stuff. I have also added my lab works for people who are interested in learning a bit further about how they work. Please don't plagiarise the content.
